# Time


#### The Solar System as a giant clock

![orbit](./time/images/orbit.jpg)


#### Day

Rotation of the earth

Duration 24 hours


Not always so

![dr.dk](./time/images/earth-slowdown.png)

Note: The Earth wobbles and slows down.
A recent news on Danish Radio revealed that 500 million years ago the earth rotation was so fast the day was only 22 hours.


#### Week

7 days

10 days?

5 days?


#### Month

The Moons orbit around the Earth

Duration 29.53 days

Note: Approximately 1 day smaller than the average of a calendar month.


#### Year

The Earths orbit around the Sun

Duration *average* 365.2422 days


#### Hours and Minutes

![ancient Egypt solar clock](./time/images/sundial.jpg)

Note: Details lost in history

Ancient Egypt: Solar clocks used to divide the day in 12 parts. The dusk and dawn hours and 10 hours between. Night was just night!
As Egypt is close to Equator the days are 12 hours long all through the year.


#### Babylon detour - counting to 12

12 is a special number as you can count to 12 on your fingers on one hand.

![counting](./time/images/01-counting.png)


#### Minutes - counting to 60

Babylon (modern Iraq) used 60 as the base number

Note: Maybe the division of hours into minutes is originating from that.



#### What year are we in?

* 2020 AD
* 1399 SH
* 1422 AH
* AM 5781
* 229 RE
* Reiwa 2
* ROC 109

Note:
* AD Anno Domini - Year of the Lord
* SH/AH Solar/Anno Hijri
* AM Anno Mundi - Year after creation
* RE - Year of the Revolution
* Reiwa - name the current Japanese emperor
* ROC - Rep. of China


#### Calender

Why?

Note: Why do we need calendars. To agree on time in the far future.
"Lets meet in two days" is okay, but lets meet next summer won't work.
In state building: Lets meet for the "law assembly" and talk next year.



#### The Calendar history


#### Prehistorical

Counting years in a given rulers period


#### Margrethe 2. - 1972

Current year is year 48 in the reign of Margrethe 2.


#### The Western Calendar

Originates from ancient Rome

Note: **Today** Solar based calendar


#### The first Roman calender

* before year 500 bc
* lunar (based on the moon)
* 10 months!
  * first month was March
  * 6 months of 30 days, 4 months of 31 -> 304 days
  * .. and a winter of 50 days - not a month
  * year length 354 days
* Epoch (year 1) Anno Urbis Conditae (AUC) 753 BC - the year of Romes foundation


#### Month 7-10

* September = 7 (latin: "septem")
* Oktober = 8 (latin "octo")
* November = 9 (latin "novem")
* December = 10 (latin "decem")

Note: Music
* 7 = septet
* 8 = octet (geometry octagon, dice with 8 sides)
* 9 = nonet
* 10 = decet


#### Roman republic

* from year 500 bc
* January and February was added as the first and second month
* March was the first month of the year
* in 154 BC, January was set as the first month of the year


#### Leap Months

* The length of the year is not following the Sun year
* Every second year a leap month with 22 or 23 days inserted after February.

* normal year = 354 days
* leap year = 376 days
* average (354 + 376) / 2 = 365 days


#### Julian Calendar

Calendar reform in Year 46 BC

The year was 3 months out of sync

March was the beginning of the Winter

Inserted 10 extra days and a leap year every 4th year

Note: Julius Caesar tired of the mess, so a calendar reform was made
The leap year was by error every 3. year the first 36 years
So with leap year, we are almost correct, but with to many leap years the year will be out of sync after only 127 years again


#### The year of Confusion

#### Year 46 BC

Two extra months (and a leap month)

378 + 67 = 445 days


#### The emperor months

July was named after the birth month of Julius Caesar

His son Augustus renamed August - the month where he have had big military victories


#### Christ

Year 1 - the birth of Christ

Is not set until Year 525

There is no year 0! You go from year 1 BC to year 1

But .. Astronomers use year 0
* 0 = 1 BC
* -1 = 2 BC

Note: More on year zero https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero


#### More on year 0 - ISO 8601

Date format: 2020-10-16

> ISO 8601:2004 (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems.

> -0001 = 2 BC.


![iso8601](./time/images/iso8601.png)



#### Out of sync - again ..

In the 1200 century the calendar was a week ahead

300 years of discussions ..


#### 1582

Pope Gregor XIII introduces the Gregorian Calendar


#### Gregorian Calendar

* Length 365 days
* Leap year every 4th year
* except if the year is divisible by 100
* except, except if divisible by 400
* so year 2000 was a leap year
* average duration 365 97/400 = 365,2425
* a problem again in 3.500 years


#### Confusions - again

* 1582 - skipping 10 days.
* Thursday October 4. to Friday October 15.
* Only in the Catholic countries


#### Denmark was late

* Denmark switched in year 1700
* Ole Rømer (of "light speed" fame) convinced the king
* skipping 11 days (**11?**) - the leap year in year 1700
* what about year 1600? A leap year both in the Julian and the Gregorian calendar
* Sunday February 18. to Monday March 1.


#### Sweden was a mess

* a sliding switch
* skipping 11 leap years in year 1700, 1704, 1708, .. 1740
* out of sync wih all neighbours in 40 years!
* forgot to skip leap years in 1704 and 1708


#### February 30.
#### 1712

Note:
* the skipped day from 1700 was added again in 1712
* 1753 finally switching - skipping 11 days.


#### Russia - the 19'th century

In Russia the Gregorian calendar was introduced after the Russian revolution in 1917

The *October* revolution (in November)

Skipping 13 days in 1918

Communism: 5/6 days work weeks in 1929-1940


#### The Olympics 1908

The Russian athletes arrived late

12(!) days


#### Other interesting calendars


#### International Fixed Calendar / 13 months

Cotsworth - 1902

![13 months](./time/images/02-13months.png)

Note:
* 28 days per month, exactly 4 weeks.
* 13 months => 364 days + Earth day at the end of the year
* Used by Kodak internally until 1989
* Problems: 13 is not divisible by 2 and 4


#### Calendar of the French Republic

* epoch 1792 (the year of the revolution)
* 12 months of 30 days
* 3 weeks of 10 days
* 10 hours in a day
* 100 minutes in an hour
* 100 seconds in a minute
* 5 extra days at the end of the year

Note:
* Extreme rationalism, no connection to religion and the king
* Trying to fit to the metric system


Used for 12 years - 1793-1805


![obelix](./time/images/obelix2.webp)


and ... for 18 days in 1871 by the
Paris Commune



#### Calendar Types

* **Solar** calendars: Based on the Earths orbit around the Sun
* **Lunar** calendars: Based on the Moons orbit around the Earth
* **Lunisolar** calendars: Based on both the Sun and the Moon


#### Lunar Calendars

* month lengh 29½ days. Typically 29 or 30 days.
* Year length is 353, 354 or 355 days (12 orbits takes 354,367 days)
* the months moves - a month is not in a fixed season (e.g. Spring)


#### The Islamic Calendar

* Lunar Hijri (AH)
* Epoch (year 0) is the year Profet Mohammed travelled from Mecca to Medina - 622 BC
* Current Year: 1442 AH
* Last New Year: August 20, 2020 AD


But, wait, the math doesn't match

`622 + 1442 = 2064`


#### Solar Calendars

* Year length is 365 or 366 days.
* The Gregorian calendar (AD)
* The Iranian (Persian) calendar - Solar Hijri (SH)
  * New Year (Nowruz): Around spring equinox (March 21.)
  * Same epoch as the Lunar Hijri - 622 BC
  * Current Year 1399 SH


#### Lunisolar Calendars

MISSING



#### Time in Denmark


#### You are BREAKING the law


#### Every single second


#### Local Time - Before 1870

* before 1870 - the clock was local
* defined by the church bell
* your time, defined by the spot where **your body** was
* almost ½ an hour from East (Bornholm) to West

Note: westernmost point is Blåvandshuk at 8° 4' 22" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Østerskær at 15° 11' 55" eastern longitude


#### The Railroad - 1870 in Jutland

![railroad](./time/images/railroad.webp)

Note: * the Copenhagen time was used all over for the trains
* the priests complained - the clock was 10 on the station but not on the church tower.


#### 1880
#### Copenhagen time in the entire country

Note: by law


![US timetable](./time/images/us-time-table.jpg)

Note: all countries had problems. In US span by more than 3 hours


#### Time Zones

* 1884 International Meridian Conference
* Greenwich Meridian is time zone 0

Note: recommendation for all countries to use time based on Greenwich


#### The law

![Danish Time Law](./time/images/timelaw.png)

Note:
* This is in effect today!
* 15° is Gudhjem on Bornholm


#### 1894

Set your clock forward by 9 minutes and 41 seconds!

We are now on *Gudhjem* UT1 time

Note: UT1 time - time based on astronomical observations of the Sun


#### The Atomic Age

Note: Along comes the Atomic Age.


#### Time (since 1967)

SI unit

Oscillations of caesium-133 atom

Note: SI = *Système international* - the International System of Units


![Timesynchronization by plane](./time/images/hp-timesync-1.png)

Note:
[HP Magazine - correlation of time](https://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1965-04.pdf)


![Timesynchronization by plane](./time/images/hp-timesync-2.png)


#### [TAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time) - International Atomic Time

Average of time from 400 atomic clocks around the world

Reported as [Julian days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day) and the Gregorian calendar are used

Note: *temps atomique international*


37 seconds ahead of UT1

Note: Since 1967


#### [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) - Coordinated Universal Time

Compromise between Astronomers (UT1) and SI (TAI)

Successor to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)


#### Name compromise as well

*Coordinated Universal Time* - CUT

*Temps Universel Coordonné* - TUC


#### Leap Seconds

the 37 seconds is handled by leap seconds

Note: [Extrapolations of the difference (TI - UT1)](https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/dutc.html) - *How long will UTC with leap seconds work?*


#### Computers, phones, etc. uses UTC


#### UTC time vs. Danish time

* Danish law is not on UTC but on UT1
* Town Hall clock in Copenhagen switched in 2012
* In 2018 the minister *considered* changing it
  * [På tide: Minister overvejer at indføre nøjagtigt dansk klokkeslæt](https://ing.dk/artikel/paa-tide-minister-overvejer-at-indfoere-noejagtigt-dansk-klokkeslaet-222791)

![Things you might not know](./time/images/things-you-might-not-know.png)



#### Computers - [Time formatting bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs)

![Time formatting bugs](./time/images/formatting-bugs.png)


#### Y2K Problem

![y2k](./time/images/y2k.jpg)

Note: The potential problem in Computer systems when entering year 2000 due to years being represented in 2 digits in many systems.


#### ROC - Y1C Problem - [Year 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2011_problem)

![The Juche Calendar 2010](./time/images/north-korea.jpg)

Note: The Republic of China (ROC) calender used in Taiwan has 2012 as year 1.
North Korea (The Juche Calendar) also affected.
2011 is year 100, the first 3 digit number.
The Republic of China existed between 1912 and 1947


#### GPS - Second rollover - [April 6., 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs#Second_GPS_rollover)

* GPS broadcasts date:
  * week number + day of week.
* 10 digits -> rollover every 1024 weeks (19.6 years)
* GPS epoch: January 6th, 1980

Note: Flight delays and ticket machines showing wrong dates
Modern GPS systems uses 13 bits, which only repeats every 157 years


#### Unix Time

[Wikipedia -> Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

The present form of UTC, with leap seconds, is defined only starting from 1 January 1972. Prior to that, since 1 January 1961 there was an older form of UTC in which not only were there occasional time steps, which were by non-integer numbers of seconds, but also the UTC second was slightly longer than the SI second, and periodically changed to continuously approximate the Earth's rotation. Prior to 1961 there was no UTC, and prior to 1958 there was no widespread atomic timekeeping; in these eras, some approximation of GMT (based directly on the Earth's rotation) was used instead of an atomic timescale.[citation needed]

The precise definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC is only uncontroversial when applied to the present form of UTC. The Unix epoch predating the start of this form of UTC does not affect its use in this era: the number of days from 1 January 1970 (the Unix epoch) to 1 January 1972 (the start of UTC) is not in question, and the number of days is all that is significant to Unix time.

The meaning of Unix time values below +63072000 (i.e., prior to 1 January 1972) is not precisely defined.



#### Time Zones, Church Calendars?

Some other day?

* Nepal (last country to settle on a timezone): UTC+05:45
* Samoa: Skipped December 30, 2011
* Church: Easter Day must be on the first Sunday after the first Full moon after Spring equinox (*First Council of Nicaea* in 325)

Note: Samoa used to be East of the date line, but traded with Australia, China, NZ - all West of the date line.
